## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-application-tracker.git
cd job-application-tracker
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate virtual environment
# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/job_tracker?sslmode=require
```

* **For local development**, you can use SQLite:

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///job_tracker.db
```

> Note: Replace `username`, `password`, and `hostname` with your PostgreSQL credentials. Do **not** commit this file with real credentials to GitHub.

### 5. Initialize the database

```bash
python app.py
```

This will automatically create the necessary tables.

### 6. Run the application

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

* **Passwords** are hashed using `Flask-Bcrypt`.
* **Session Management** ensures users cannot access other users’ data.
* **Database Credentials** are stored securely in `.env` files, never hard-coded.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

* Works with **PostgreSQL** on cloud platforms such as:

  * **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**
  * **Heroku Postgres**
  * **ElephantSQL**, **Supabase**, **Railway**, etc.
* Update `DATABASE_URL` in the cloud environment `.env` or environment variables before deployment.

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* Add **email notifications** for application status changes.
* Integrate **OAuth login** (Google, GitHub).
* Provide **analytics charts** for application trends.
* Support **file attachments** (resumes, cover letters) per job application.
